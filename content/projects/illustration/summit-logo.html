<h2>The Project</h2>

<p>Every year, Girl Develop It hosts a summit for chapter leaders and organizers from all over the country. It's a time to gather, share ideas, and celebrate eachothers' achievements. GDI commissioned me to make a logo that would commemorate the 2016 summit in Austin.</p>

<p>The requirements for the logo were that it represented the geographical setting, mentioned the summit's year and location, and represented the spirit of Girl Develop It.</p>

<h3>First draft</h3>

<p>The timeline for this project was very quick, so we only had time for one set of revisions. The team felt that the woman in this initial design looked a little lonely in the desert by herself, so I gave her some friends.</p>

<h2>Final Design</h2>

<p>The final design portrays a couple of strong ladies joining hands in the arid landscape of the southwest United States.</p>
