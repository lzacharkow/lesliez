<h2>The Project</h2>

<p>Girl Develop It is an organization that helps women of all ages learn to code in a judgement-free atmosphere. I was asked to create an infographic to celebrate the organization's 5-year anniversary.</p>

<p>I began by working with them to gather noteworthy statistics. Then, I determined content strategy based on the information we had. The infographic would have 4 sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>History</li>
	<li>Today's milestones</li>
	<li>Growth statistics</li>
	<li>Events & programs</li>
</ol>

<p>I created wireframes and illustration samples along the way, and we worked together to write and gather content to fill out the infographic.</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<h3>Infographic</h3>

<p>The final infographic begins with Girl Develop It's roots and shows how far they've come. It highlights statistics, growth metrics, community programs, and closes with a call to action to get involved.</p>

<h3>Info bits</h3>

<p>To get the most mileage out of the infographic, I also delivered what I call "info bits". They're bite-sized PNGs of each module from the infographic for Girl Develop It members to reuse and reorganize into presentations, brochures, or on the web like I did <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/donate" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Between the infographic and its individual parts, GDI could to show off the impressive statistics from the infographic where ever they pleased.</p>
