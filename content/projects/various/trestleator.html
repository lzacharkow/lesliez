<h2>About</h2>

<p>The Trestleator is a custom projection application for the Trestle Inn, a gogo-inspired bar that blends vintage with high-tech. The Trestleator controls a massive video collage projected on the bar's high exposed walls; a glowing backdrop for classy go-go dancers and authentic whiskey sours. The application allows the bar to manage their expansive archive of vintage videos and curate each night's projections according to tags.</p>

<p>The Trestleator is set up in two steps. First, bar managers upload videos to a computer tucked away behind the bar with the Trestleator's desktop app. Second, the videos are given any number of custom tags (ie. Black + White, Tina Turner, Go-Go). From there, the mobile app takes over.</p>

<p>The Trestleator's mobile app lets users set the night's video ambience by blending tags from the libary, and picking one of four pre-set video arrangements.</p>

<p>The mobile app can be accessed anywhere a wifi connection exists, so managers can easily control the Trestleator remotely and at a moment's notice.</p>
