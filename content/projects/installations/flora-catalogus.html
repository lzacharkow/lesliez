<h2>About</h2>

<p>Nature assumes the role of John Bartram, the early American horticulturist, in this interactive sound collage. How would a solitary tree choose to catalogue its experience with us? Visitors are encouraged to talk, sing, or hum, and hear how the tree responds.</p>

<p>This installation was made in collaboration with <a href="http://kylestetz.com" target="_blank">Kyle Stetz</a>, as a part of <a href="http://datagarden.org/5665/the-switched-on-garden-002/" target="_blank">Data Garden's Switched-On Garden 002</a>. At the Switched-On Garden, visitors are invited to interact with several curated bio-interactive sound installations scattered over 46 acres of ground at Bartram's Garden in Philadelphia. Visitors connect with their natural environment through live music, performance and sculpture that blurs the distinction between biological and digital worlds.</p>
