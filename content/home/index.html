Hi there, I’m Leslie. I’m a UX designer and developer from Philadelphia, living in Berkeley.
<br>
Formerly, I was a Senior UX Designer/Developer at Opower, where I built products that nudged people to save energy. Before that, I worked on the online shopping experience at Urban Outfitters as a Product Manager/Interaction Designer.
<br>
The culmination of my life’s work is a Chrome extension called <a href="">Tabby Cat</a>.
<br>
In my free time, I like to turn off my computer, go outside, and make new friends. Say hi!
