<p>At Opower, many different people are involved in product development. The bubbles below represent the team members that I worked most closely with.</p>

<p>A typical design process begins when a Product Manager hands off a product requirements document to the design team. UX Designers use these requirements to develop concepts and wireframes as they move through the earlier phases of the design process. UX researchers conduct exploratory research to inform the initial direction of the design, and later contribute qualitative usability studies.</p>

<p>UX Designer/Developers like me help to refine the details of the design and tie it into our design system. We also contribute code specs and often build products for production. We partner closely with Engineering to code review eachother's work and make sure the final result works smoothly and follows the design system.</p>
