<p>Product development at Urban Outfitters was a collaboration between Creative, Engineering, Analytics, and my Product Management/UX team.</p>

<p>New projects came from strategic objectives that were defined at the executive level and handed down to my team to develop into features. As a product manager and UX designer, I would begin by defining goals with various stakeholders, then iterate on ideas, and finally produce wireframes and product requirements.</p>

<p>Then, I would hand the wireframes and requirements to Creative for visual specs, and Engineering to build the feature's framework. When Creative was finished with design specs, Engineering would apply these styles to the framework they'd built. Before the product was finished, I would work with Analytics to define KPIs that would measure the success of our original goals. Analytics would translate these KPIs into tracking requirements that Engineering would implement and ship with the feature.</p>

<p>This is a process that I refined and oversaw during my time at Urban Outfitters. It helped all of the teams work closely together to ship and iterate on features.</p>
